# Demo Pitch Script

1.  **Opening Hook (Show Hero):** "Healthcare is confusing. 90% of patients struggle to understand their diagnosis. Meet ArogyaVani—your personal medical translator that turns complex jargon into clear, 5th-grade English."
2.  **The "Magic" (Upload/Simplify):** "Watch this. I'll take a photo of a complex consent form (or paste this text with 'Myocardial Infarction'). With one click, our Hybrid AI detects the text and simplifies it instantly, highlighting 'Heart Attack' so I actually understand the risk."
3.  **Accessibility (Show TTS):** "Health literacy is for everyone. For elderly or visually impaired patients, we have built-in Text-to-Speech. (Click Play) It reads the simplified instructions clearly."
4.  **Verification (Show Quiz):** "But did they understand? We don't just dump text. We auto-generate a 'Comprehension Check' to ensure the patient knows exactly what to do next. (Click Quiz options)."
5.  **Privacy & Speed (Mention Local/Audit):** "We care about privacy. Our local engine handles common terms right on the device for zero-latency, while our audit log tracks quality without exposing PII."
6.  **Call to Action (Show Footer/Mobile View):** "ArogyaVani is fully responsive and ready to deploy. It’s not just an app; it’s a bridge to better health outcomes. Thank you."
